## 1. Architecture Comparison Analysis

### 1.1 Human 1.0 Architecture: Biologically Integrated System

Traditional humans are highly integrated but closed systems. The neural center is physically bound to sensors, actuators, and maintenance systems, unable to be separated, replaced, or independently expanded.

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Structure** | Integrated, hardware and software tightly coupled |
| **Interface** | Non-standardized biological interfaces, low bandwidth, high latency |
| **Evolution** | Dependent on slow biological evolution (million-year scale) |
| **System Nature** | Closed system with fixed functions |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Neural Center (Brain)          │
│       ↕ Permanent bio-coupling  │
│  Sensors + Actuators + Support  │
│  (Cannot replace, cannot expand)│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.2 Human 3.0 Architecture: Open Neural Core

The core idea of Human 3.0 architecture is separating **computation cores** from **functional modules**. Through standardized neural interfaces, neural cores can connect with any pluggable external modules, forming an open, extensible intelligent network.

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Structure** | Modular, core decoupled from peripherals |
| **Interface** | Standardized Neural Interface Protocol (NIP), high bandwidth, low latency |
| **Evolution** | Technology-iterative upgrades (month/year scale) |
| **System Nature** | Extensible open system |
