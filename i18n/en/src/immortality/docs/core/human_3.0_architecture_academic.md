# Open Neural Architecture Design: Architectural Transition from Integrated Biological Systems to Modular Neural Network Entities

---

## Abstract

This paper proposes an open neural architecture design aimed at achieving an architectural transition from integrated biological systems (Human 1.0/2.0) to modular neural network entities (Human 3.0). Core features of this architecture include: decoupling of neural computation cores from peripheral modules, standardized neural interface protocols, and network topologies supporting multi-core interconnection. This research systematically analyzes the comparative characteristics of both architectures, component specifications, neural internet architecture, implementation roadmap, and risk constraints. The study demonstrates that this architectural design lays the theoretical foundation for unlimited cognitive capability expansion, but must be implemented within clearly defined physical constraints and ethical frameworks.

**Keywords**: Modular neural architecture; Neural interface protocol; Neural internet; Open core; Cognitive expansion; Architecture design

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

The traditional human nervous system is a highly integrated but closed system. The neural center is physically bound to sensors, actuators, and maintenance systems, unable to be separated, replaced, or independently expanded. This architectural characteristic constitutes the physical foundation of existential constraints in the cognitive dimension.

### 1.2 Research Objective

This research aims to propose an open neural architecture design that achieves decoupling and expansion of cognitive capabilities by separating **computation cores** from **functional modules**. This architectural design serves as the core technical specification for the "Cognitive Dimension" within the "Immortality Project" framework.

### 1.3 Theoretical Positioning

This research belongs to the intersection of Neural Engineering and Cognitive Architecture, providing a theoretical framework and technical specifications for the design of modular neural systems.

## 2. Architecture Comparison Analysis

### 2.1 Human 1.0 Architecture: Integrated Biological System

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Structure | Integrated, hardware and software tightly coupled |
| Interface | Non-standardized biological interfaces, low bandwidth, high latency |
| Evolution | Dependent on slow biological evolution (million-year scale) |
| System Nature | Closed system with fixed functions |

Formal representation:

$$\text{System}_{1.0} = \{C, P, A, M\}_{\text{coupled}}$$

Where $C$ = neural core, $P$ = sensors, $A$ = actuators, $M$ = maintenance systems, subscript "coupled" indicates tight coupling relationship.

### 2.2 Human 3.0 Architecture: Open Neural Core

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Structure | Modular, core decoupled from peripherals |
| Interface | Standardized Neural Interface Protocol (NIP), high bandwidth, low latency |
| Evolution | Technology-iterative upgrades (month/year scale) |
| System Nature | Extensible open system |

Formal representation:

$$\text{System}_{3.0} = C \oplus \text{NIP} \oplus \{P_1, P_2, ..., P_n, A_1, A_2, ..., A_m\}$$

Where $\oplus$ represents modular connection through standard interfaces, $n, m \to \infty$ indicates scalability.

### 2.3 Architecture Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | 1.0 Architecture | 3.0 Architecture | Transformative Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Structure | Closed, integrated | Open, modular | From fixed hardware to upgradeable platform |
| Perception | Limited to biological senses | Extensible to any sensors | Unlimited expansion of perceptual boundaries |
| Computation | Individual brain independent operation | Cluster collaboration and distributed learning | From monolithic intelligence to networked superintelligence |
| Interaction | Low-bandwidth mediation like language | High-bandwidth direct neural signal connection | Elimination of communication loss |
| Evolution | Darwinian biological evolution | Technology-iterative upgrades | Exponential increase in evolution rate |
| System Nature | Isolated closed system | Open node in global intelligence network | Individual becomes part of network |

## 3. Architecture Component Specifications

### 3.1 Neural Core

The neural core is the central computation unit of the architecture, responsible only for high-level cognitive functions.

| Interface Requirements | Bidirectional signal transmission, single-neuron resolution, millisecond-level latency |

### 3.2 Standardized Interface

The Neural Interface Protocol (NIP) enables high-bandwidth, low-latency data exchange between neural cores and external modules.

**Protocol Stack Design**:

| Layer | Function | Analogy |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Application Layer | High-level commands ("move arm") | HTTP |
| Neural Encoding Layer | Population coding, rate coding | Data format |
| Signal Processing Layer | Filtering, artifact removal | TCP |
| Hardware Abstraction Layer | Device drivers | Drivers |
| Physical Layer | Electrodes, optrodes, nanoelectrodes | Physical medium |

**Performance Metrics**:

| Metric | Target Value | Theoretical Basis |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Bandwidth | $\geq 100$ Mbps | Complete sensory replacement requirement |
| Latency | $< 10$ ms | Perceptual-motor continuity |
| Channel Count | $\geq 10^6$ | Single-neuron resolution |
| Error Rate | $< 0.1\%$ | Reliability requirement |

### 3.3 Peripheral Modules

Peripheral modules follow plug-and-play design principles, categorized by function:

| Category | Examples | Expansion Capability |

## 4. Neural Internet Architecture

### 4.1 Topology

When multiple neural cores are interconnected through standard interfaces, they form a Neural Internet.

**Point-to-Point Mode**:

$$C_A \xleftrightarrow{\text{encrypted}} C_B$$

Application scenarios: Intimate communication, skill transfer, shared experiences

**Mesh Network Mode**:

$$\{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\} \text{ peer-to-peer interconnection}$$

Application scenarios: Collective intelligence, emergent swarm behavior

### 4.2 Communication Protocols

| Signal Type | Description | Bandwidth | Application |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| Raw Neural | Direct spike train transmission | $10^9$ bps | Consciousness fusion |
| Encoded Representation | Feature vectors, semantic embeddings | $10^6$ bps | Sensory sharing |
| Symbolic | High-level semantic messages | $10^2$ bps | Basic messaging |

### 4.3 Emergent Properties

N interconnected neural cores may exhibit superlinear computational capability:

$$C_{\text{network}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i + f(\text{connectivity}, \text{synergy})$$

Where $f$ represents emergent computational gains from:
- Task specialization and parallelization
- Cross-domain knowledge integration
- Reduced communication overhead (elimination of language translation)

**Theoretical Model**:

Let individual capability be $C_i$, then:
- Isolated sum: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i$
- Networked sum: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i + f(\text{connectivity}, \text{synergy})$

When $f > 0$, the networked system exhibits superlinear capability growth.

## 8. Conclusion

The Human 3.0 architecture represents a fundamental transition from **biological organisms** to **evolvable neural network entities**. Through modular design and standardized interfaces, this architecture achieves:

1. Decoupling and augmentation of cognitive capabilities
2. Sharing of learning and experience
3. Plasticity of existential forms

Ultimately, this architecture will break through existential constraints in the cognitive dimension, greatly expanding the possibility state space of civilization. However, it must be emphasized that implementation of this architecture must proceed within clearly defined physical constraints and ethical frameworks.
