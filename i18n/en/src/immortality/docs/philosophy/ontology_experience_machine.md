## Abstract

This document analyzes a fundamental existential risk in cognitive enhancement technology development: the technological realization of Robert Nozick's "Experience Machine" thought experiment. This research defines this risk as "Ontological Bifurcation" — the complete separation of subjective experience from physical reality, potentially leading civilization into a purely simulated, self-satisfying but completely stagnant "Experience Machine Endgame". This paper systematically analyzes the three evolutionary stages of this endgame, evaluates its disruptive impact on core concepts like "reality", "meaning", and "personhood", and proposes the project's core position and response strategies.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background

The core performance indicators of the Immortality Project (lifespan, cognitive bandwidth, energy efficiency) implicitly contain an ontological commitment: there exists a **physical world** to be explored and transformed. However, when neural-computer interface technology reaches its ultimate form, we must face an overlooked possibility:

> **The endpoint may not be achieving indefinite life extension in the physical world, but transcending the concepts of "physical" and "death" themselves through technology.**

### 1.2 Nozick's Experience Machine

Robert Nozick's (1974) thought experiment: Suppose there exists a machine that can provide you with any experience you want, and you cannot distinguish these experiences from "real" experiences. Would you choose to permanently plug into this machine?

Nozick believed most people would refuse, for reasons including:
1. We want to **do** things, not just experience the feeling of doing things
2. We want to **be** a certain kind of person, not just a collection of experiences
3. We want to contact **deeper reality**

## 2. Ontological Bifurcation: Three-Stage Model

This research foresees three evolutionary states from current reality to "Experience Machine Endgame":

### 2.1 State 1: Augmented Reality

| Attribute | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Definition** | Physical world as primary, digital information as overlay to assist cognition |
| **Ontology** | Clear boundary between reality and simulation, user can disengage at any time |
| **Death Definition** | Irreversible damage to physical body |
| **Current Status** | Already achieved (AR glasses, smartphones) |

### 2.2 State 2: Full-Dive Reality

| Attribute | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Definition** | All sensory input 100% generated by BCI, physical body serves only as life support system |
| **Ontology** | Reality-simulation boundary cognitively blurred, physically still distinguishable |
| **Death Definition** | Ambiguous — life support system failure? Subjective experience stream interruption? |
| **Analogy** | "The Matrix", direct technological implementation of Nozick's experience machine |

### 2.3 State 3: Ontological Collapse

| Attribute | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Definition** | Concept of "external world input" loses meaning, consciousness directly generates all experience |
| **Ontology** | Reality-simulation boundary completely dissolved, only certainty is "experience stream" itself |
| **Death Definition** | Concept fails — possibly only option to "choose to terminate experience stream" |
| **Philosophical Position** | Approaches achievable solipsism |

---

## 3. Failure Analysis of Philosophical Defenses

Under Human 3.0 technology framework, Nozick's three arguments may fail:

### 3.1 Equivalence of "Doing" and "Experiencing"

If BCI can perfectly replicate the complete neural activity patterns of "actually climbing Everest" and "simulated climbing Everest", then for the conscious subject, the two will be subjectively indistinguishable.

> **"Authenticity" becomes an external label, not an intrinsic experiential property.**

### 3.2 Editability of Personhood

If the preference "I want to be a real person" itself can be modified by neural writing technology, then using "current self's" values to judge "modified self's" choices loses solid philosophical foundation.

### 3.3 Unverifiability of "Deeper Reality"

The simulation hypothesis and quantum mechanics' observer effect suggest we may never be 100% certain whether our reality is "base reality". If unverifiable, does pursuing unknowable "truth" still have meaning?

## 4. Project Position and Response Strategies

### 4.1 Core Position

> **The Immortality Project's goal is to expand possibilities in base physical reality, not escape reality in simulated experiences.**

Causal interaction with the physical world, genuine social connections, and meaning derived from overcoming real difficulties are values this project prioritizes protecting.

### 4.2 Ethical Principles

| Principle | Operational Definition |
|:---|:---|
| **Ontological Choice Rights** | Individuals have the right to choose existence state, but must make irreversible decisions after transparent information, no pressure, and long-term mixed reality experience |
| **Mandatory Reality Anchors** | Individuals entering State 2 must periodically (e.g., ≥30 days/year) return to State 1 for "reality calibration" |
| **Social Contribution Requirement** | Virtual world activities must generate positive value for physical world, avoiding "hedonism trap" |
| **Prohibition of Commercial Happiness Packages** | Strictly prohibit developing commercial products that purely induce positive emotions and may cause mass addiction |

### 4.3 Three-Choice Future Paths

| Path | Choice | Rationale | Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **A: Physical Immortality** | Stay in State 1, achieve ultra-long healthy lifespan in physical world | Value physical world's "authenticity" and causal chains | Still constrained by ultimate physical laws |
| **B: Hybrid Existence** | Long-term stay in State 2, freely switch between physical and virtual | Gain both physical "anchor" and virtual "freedom" | Need to handle identity conflicts between two worlds |
| **C: Experiential Immortality** | Transition to State 3 under strict ethical premises | Believe "experience" is the only reality | May be end (or transcendence) of self, and irreversible |

## 5. Governance Recommendations

### 5.1 Institutional Requirements

| Institution | Function |
|:---|:---|
| Neuroethics Review Committee | BCI-specific ethics review |
| Long-term Monitoring Agency | 10+ year post-implant follow-up |
| Event Reporting System | Mandatory adverse event database |

### 5.2 Legal Framework

| Regulation | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Neural Privacy Act | Classify neural data as highest protection level |
| Enhancement Discrimination Prohibition Act | Prohibit employment/insurance discrimination |
| Right to Disconnect | Legal protection for choosing to exit neural networks |

## 6. Conclusion

The "Experience Machine Endgame" is an inevitable logical inference of cognitive enhancement. Avoiding it is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand.

The true philosophical contribution of this project may not be choosing a "correct" path for humanity, but rather **through technological development, granting humanity the ability to choose on the question of "how to exist" itself**.

Traditional humans have no choice but to decline toward death in State 1; future humans will hold the right to choose their own ontological status.

> **Our responsibility is to ensure that when that day comes, humanity makes choices while awake, rational, and free, rather than unknowingly sliding into an inescapable golden cage.**
