# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- ❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- ❌ Public or private harassment
- ❌ Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Academic Integrity

As a project involving philosophy, science, and technology, we particularly value:

### Citation Standards

- Properly cite others' work
- Avoid plagiarism and academic misconduct
- Maintain critical thinking about cited literature

### Scientific Rigor

- Distinguish between "hypothesis", "theory", and "established fact"
- Acknowledge research limitations
- Welcome evidence-based criticism

### Ethical Responsibility

- Consider ethical implications when discussing technology
- Respect different values and beliefs
- Do not promote potentially harmful technological applications

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported through the project team's GitHub Issues. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
