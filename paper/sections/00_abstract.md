# Wetware Engineering: Applying Software Engineering Paradigms to Biological System Construction

**A Cross-Disciplinary Methodology for Modular Life Systems**

---

## Abstract

Software engineering underwent a paradigm shift from monolithic, handcrafted programs to modular, composable systems over five decades—a transformation enabled by standardized interfaces, package managers, version control, and runtime orchestration. Biological engineering, despite remarkable advances in synthetic biology, organoids, and tissue engineering, remains trapped in an analogous "pre-modular" era: each biological system is constructed from scratch, results are difficult to reproduce across laboratories, and there exists no universal language for describing biological component composition.

We propose **Wetware Engineering**, a cross-disciplinary methodology that systematically transfers software engineering's core abstractions—modularity, interface standardization, dependency management, and runtime orchestration—to biological system construction. This is not merely applying computational tools to biology, but fundamentally reconceptualizing how living systems should be designed, described, and assembled.

Our contribution is threefold: (1) **Conceptual Framework**: We define the Component-Interface-Runtime triad as the foundational abstraction for modular biological systems, drawing explicit parallels to software architecture patterns. (2) **Technical Specifications**: We propose Bio-Component Spec, a standardized schema for describing biological modules, and Bio-DSL, a domain-specific language for declarative system composition—both designed following software engineering best practices. (3) **Paradigm Analysis**: We systematically analyze how software engineering concepts map to biological contexts, identifying both direct translations and fundamental differences requiring novel solutions.

Wetware Engineering represents a paradigm-level contribution: shifting biological system construction from "artisanal replication" to "engineered composition." While implementation faces significant biological challenges, establishing this conceptual and methodological foundation is a necessary first step toward reproducible, iterable, and collaborative biological system development.
